Welcome to SodukoSolver!

In this Repo, you can see how I solved an assignment from CMPT477 Introduction to Formal Verification / CMPT777 Formal Verification
at Simon Fraser Universiy in British Columbia, Canada.

You can find the Instructions in the PDF titled "Instructions".

If you would like to see what was provided by my professor Dr. Yuepeng Wang, you can look at the Repo's first ever commit.
